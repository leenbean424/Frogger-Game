# Group47_Frogger
This is the github repository for CS 2340 Group 47's Frogger project to be implemented with Android Studio.

We are currently working on Sprint 1 which entails:
1. Start Screen 
    o A way to start the game 
    o A way to quit the game 
2. Initial Configuration Screen 
    o An input for player name 
        ▪ Name cannot be whitespace-only, empty, or null 
    o A way to choose difficulty of the game 
    o A way to pick a character sprite to represent the player 
    o A way to continue to the game screen 
3. Game Screen 
    o This screen is where the actual game will take place. This is where most of the functionality in later sprints is implemented. For now, the screen will: 
        ▪ Display starting lives 
        ▪ Player name 
        ▪ Display player character sprite depending on the selected character
